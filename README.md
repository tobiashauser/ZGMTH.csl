This style is furthermore  based on guideline [<ins>Zitate und Fu√ünoten</ins>](https://www.gmth.de/formatierung.aspx#zf) by the [ZGMTH](https://www.gmth.de/zeitschrift.aspx).

The citation style is written in the XML-based [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/)-spec. The documentation can be found [here](https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html).

It is most convenient to use the [Visual CSL Editor](https://editor.citationstyles.org/visualEditor/). To see a how a style can look use the provided [American Psychological Association 7th Edition](apa.csl) which already looks very similar to what is needed.
